#1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.

# List of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Variable to store the sum
total_sum = 0

# Loop through each number in the list and add it to total_sum
for num in numbers:
    total_sum += num

# Print the result
print("The sum of all items in the list is:", total_sum)

#OUTPUT
#The sum of all items in the list is: 150
